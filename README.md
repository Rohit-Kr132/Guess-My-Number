## Guess My Number Game

This is a simple "Guess My Number" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 20, and you have 10 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the game provides hints like "too high" or "too low" to help you get closer to the correct number.

### How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Start guessing! Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
3. After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
    * **Correct:** If you guess the right number, you win! The game will display a congratulatory message and the number of attempts it took you.
    * **Too High:** If your guess is higher than the chosen number, the game will tell you "Too high!".
    * **Too Low:** If your guess is lower than the chosen number, the game will tell you "Too low!".
4. You have 10 attempts to guess the number. If you run out of attempts, the game will reveal the correct number and you can try again.
